# F-X255, Prepare Word 0.16.2 and PowerPoint 0.14.2 patch releases

**Status**: draft
**Sprint**: S95
**Size**: L
**Depends on**: F-X221, F-X248, F-X249, F-X251, F-X252, F-X253, F-X256, F-X257, F-X258

## Rescope checkpoint

The user expanded active S95 with F-X256, F-X257 and F-X258 after this
preparation began. This prior design is stale and parked in draft. Preserve
the dirty worker and intermediate receipts. No implementation, handoff or
source availability push resumes until those dependencies complete and this
plan is revised and approved against the expanded integrated source. The
remaining text records the prior contract and must be reconciled then.

## Problem

The five S95 repairs are complete, but Cargo.toml:36 and the binding projects
still prepare Word0.16.1 and shared/PowerPoint0.14.1. The user requests Rust
and Python releases at the end of S95 and explicitly retains the0.16.x and
0.14.x version lines. The published baseline is both complete family tags at
80117123c1073b826392b06a6e6601311a929b44. Current release prose still names the
preceding0.16.0/0.14.0 baseline. Version carriers, current assertions, notes and
artifacts must agree before release approval is possible.

## Approach

Use the existing release families and workflow. No new product API, module,
file, crate, dependency, release framework or runtime behavior is authorized.
The only Rust source edits are existing current-version assertions or contract
literals required by the carrier map. Preserve code and accepted rendering.

Set the root workspace version and effective inherited Word/support carriers
to0.16.2. Set the fifteen explicit shared/PowerPoint published manifests and
rpptx-py binding to0.14.2. Align both Python projects, internal workspace pins,
applicable lock records, CLI/install/readme examples and current CI/WASM
contract literals. Keep inherited version.workspace structure. Preserve
rpptx-wasm's own0.12.1 version and npm boundary, publish=false, external
versions and historical release/recovery/performance evidence. Inspect every
manifest, lockfile and README diff semantically, without mass replacement.
The finite carrier intake identifies ten inherited packages, sixteen explicit
versions,24 internal pins and27 lock records, of which26 versions change.

Separate live current-carrier assertions from immutable historical note tests
in scripts/test_sprint_workflow.py. Keep the S91 historical0.16.1/0.14.1 note
inventories and contributor sets intact, following the existing S90 pattern.
Add a target-specific release regression in that existing module, establish
actual RED against current pre-preparation source, and prove both target
families, allowlists, pins/binding versions and meaningful family-only notes.
Update other assertions only where their operands read current source.

Add exact v0.16.2 and rpptx-v0.14.2 CHANGELOG sections with the five required
subsections. Authenticate the contribution inventory since the actual published
baseline. Distinguish direct donor provenance from adapted/hardened equivalent
work and closed-but-unmerged PRs. Do not recount the earlier40-issue/30-PR
release inventory as new. Retain explicit bounded equation/native/oracle
limitations and the intentional prior render deltas. Describe supported form,
signing, chart and source-owned XML behavior without claiming future work.

Disclose the approved Rust rendering source changes since the published
baseline: revision_style fields on RenderOptions/LayoutInput, ParagraphBlock's
bool-to-Option<Color> change bar and NoteLayout's color-valued revision ranges.
Plain remains default and stored formatting is unchanged. Disclose the ZIP9
OpcError::Zip upstream type boundary and named Python refusals. Patch numbering
does not imply full source compatibility. Do not claim Issue385 or Issue386
closure, new default-template numbering, Python3.14 qualification, future
fillable PDF, bibliography/navigation or pending interoperability. Issue386
belongs to S95.1 and the remaining Issue385 groups to S95.11.

Rebuild and retain genuine verified archives for the exact22 published union
with all22 local patches, --locked and verification enabled. No upload occurs.
Inspect exact packaged source/README/manifest bytes, normalized members and
10MiB ceiling. Root alone updates archive catalog and measured README rows
after actual measurement and closed source guards. Preserve historical
performance versions/dates and unchanged inventory tolerances. A no-verify
package command is measurement support, never publication verification.

Build fresh ordinary Python wheels and both CLIs from the final local source.
Bind actual wheel METADATA/RECORD, source and imported native identities,
versions and clean Python3.9/3.12 runtime outcomes. Execute the existing exact
42 Word and44 PowerPoint priority inventories under both interpreters and
strict mypy/stub checks under3.12. Final integrated acceptance additionally
runs the complete installed suites and the sprint's public/native/reporter
union, without relabeling prior producers.

The actual both-family wheels.yml workflow_dispatch rehearsal requires the
prepared reviewed source on GitHub. After all local scoped checks and an
independent clean microscope, use the documented source availability handoff
with concrete pending hosted gates, leaving this plan approved and in-progress.
Root batch-integrates that handoff and authenticates the clean canonical
sprint ref/SHA before its source availability push and no-input dispatch.
No worker push, main merge, tag or publication is authorized here.

Authenticate the actual run SHA and all27 successful build/aggregate jobs with
four publication/release jobs skipped. Inspect all26 unique raw payloads,
including twelve wheels, two sdists and twelve CLIs, without double counting
aggregate copies. Download and validate each family's exact six wheels and
one sdist through the existing python-release-artifacts contract, including
full metadata and target tags. Install the actual host-matching downloaded
wheels in fresh3.9/3.12 environments, execute the priority inventories under
both versions and strict typing/stub checks under3.12. Actual native hosted
3.12 typing is not priority runtime evidence. Failed or pending hosted gates
keep the story in-progress. Any material source change invalidates affected
local or hosted evidence.

After actual hosted acceptance, complete ordinary feature records. Final
integrated full verification and sprint review remain closure requirements.
Only close-sprint may merge main or create the sprint tag. Subsequent release
commands require fresh main verification and separate approval for each exact
family tag at that reviewed SHA, shared/PowerPoint first. This preparation
gate does not defer its own completion to registry publication.

## Rejected alternatives

- A0.17.0/0.15.0 bump contradicts the explicit version-line decision.
- Global version replacement corrupts historical evidence and separate WASM authority.
- Treating build-only dispatch as publication invents registry and attestation evidence.
- Deferring preparation completion until release creates a circular main-release prerequisite.
- Reusing old wheels or no-verify archives cannot prove final versioned artifacts.

## Test plan

| Category | Test | Asserts |
|---|---|---|
| release regression | target-specific S95 patch family test in scripts/test_sprint_workflow.py | Actual old-source RED, exact0.16.2/0.14.2 families, matching bindings/pins/locks/notes and unchanged WASM exclusion |
| policy | Complete scripts.test_sprint_workflow module | Current carriers move while immutable historical notes/credits and meaningful mismatch negatives remain protected |
| scoped Rust | Changed-crate default tests and all-target/all-feature clippy from the actual claim diff | Existing version-contract assertions and changed package surfaces pass, excluding PyO3 Rust test binaries |
| packaging | Genuine workspace publication dry-run with exact22 local patches | Actual22 Verifying records, correct target versions, unique members, final source/README identities and archives below10MiB |
| local installed | Fresh both-family wheels/CLIs, clean Python3.9 and3.12 priority suites, strict3.12 mypy/stub | Actual distributions and native libraries have exact versions and pass42/44 priority inventories with immutable input/source identities |
| docs and WASM | Applicable README examples/measurements and both WASM checks | Current install/API examples work, actual measured rows agree, WASM0.12.1 and historical performance records remain distinct |
| hosted build-only | Actual wheels.yml workflow_dispatch at reviewed source SHA | All27 deciding jobs succeed, four publication guards skip, exact26 unique payloads and family metadata validation |
| downloaded installed | Fresh host-matching actual hosted wheels on3.9/3.12 plus3.12 typing/stub | Hosted artifact rather than local build supplies the tested distribution and complete RECORD/native identity |

The backlog test gate is release regression. Full integrated workspace, full
installed/public/reporter/native union, supply-chain and sprint review run after
integration as the sprint gate. Actual publication is outside this story.

## Risk routing

Release scripting/version strings: read release.md and HLD15 Release process,
inspect all manifest/lock/README diffs, actual archive/version/metadata checks,
clean full final gate and separate final approval before tags. Published family
contracts: HLD10 Packaging and structural rules, disclose source compatibility,
genuine22 publication dry-run and10MiB assertions. PyO3/WASM: real installed
priority inventories on3.9/3.12, strict3.12 typing/stub and both WASM graphs,
with no Rust binding test binary. No dependency graph/default/font change or
new external oracle is planned. Existing scoped/full obligations remain.

## Hash harness

Expected unchanged49 hashes and seven deterministic pixel buffers. Version and
release metadata do not change accepted document paint. No baseline lease.
Prior intentional S93 behavior changes remain attributed in notes, not a new
F-X255 delta. Preserve the existing bounded historical PPT mutant applicability
exception for the exact test-only chart version assertion, with all other
production bytes unchanged.

## Implementation checklist

- [ ] Establish actual target-specific old-source RED and preserve historical contracts.
- [ ] Align exact version carriers, current assertions and family contribution notes.
- [ ] Pass scoped local Rust/Python/WASM/docs/policy/hash checks and independent microscope.
- [ ] Qualify genuine22 archives and root-owned measured catalog/README reconciliation.
- [ ] Prepare and integrate source availability handoff with explicit pending hosted gates.
- [ ] Pass actual SHA-bound hosted build-only jobs and downloaded metadata/runtime/typing checks.
- [ ] Complete ordinary preparation records, leaving publication to separate release approval.

## Open questions

No material unanswered user question. Both Rust/Python families and the0.16.x
and0.14.x lines are explicit. Candidate0.16.2/0.14.2 versions and remote tags
were absent in the authenticated registry intake and must be rechecked at the
release boundary. The earlier approved Rust source changes remain disclosed.
Registry roles and trusted-publisher configuration must be verified before the
separate final publication approval, not invented from build-only success.
