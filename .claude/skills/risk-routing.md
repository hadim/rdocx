description: Route a design plan to the mandatory reading and the extra verification riders its diff earns. Matched rows add obligations and never remove the normal test plan.

# Skill: risk-routing

Some diffs in this workspace are ordinary and some can break output on a
machine you do not own without failing to compile. This router names the second
kind.

Use it during `/design`, during `/run-sprint` wave planning, and when building
the consolidated sprint gate. **Load only the rows the proposed diff triggers.**
A matched row adds reading and final integrated checks. It never replaces the
story's local regressions or drops a qualification obligation. Run the union
once at final sprint acceptance. Do not rerun whole suites, external oracles,
publication, documentation, WASM or font riders per story.

## The table

| Trigger | Read before editing | Mandatory concern |
|---|---|---|
| Unit conversion, `Twips`, `Emu`, `Points`, `Inches` | `docs/hld/01-glossary.md` units, `CLAUDE.md` "Things that are deliberately wrong" | Constructors truncate with `as i64` and that is pinned by tests. Rounding shifts every twip, which shifts layout. Declare the harness delta |
| Theme colour, tint, shade, colour mapping | `docs/hld/05-drawingml-model.md` | `rdocx_oxml::theme::apply_tint_shade` is deliberately naive. Add spec-correct work under a new name in `oxml-drawing`. Do not correct the old function |
| Layout, pagination, line breaking, text shaping | `docs/hld/08-rendering-spec.md` | Deterministic font mode for every baseline. A baseline recorded against system fonts is worthless. Re-record deliberately, never incidentally |
| Any parser or serialiser | `docs/hld/04-opc-and-packaging.md`, `06-presentationml-model.md` | `xsd:sequence` child order on write. Prefix-tolerant on read, fixed prefix on write. Round-trip test proving `capture_element` preserved the unmodelled subtree byte for byte |
| Crate dependency graph, a new `use` across families | `docs/hld/03-architecture.md` | `oxml-*` must not depend on `rdocx-*` or `rpptx-*`. The single documented exception is `oxml-drawing -> rdocx-oxml` for the `Theme` adapter |
| Bundled fonts, `crates/rpptx/assets/` | `docs/hld/15-build-and-toolchain.md` | Every font family needs its licence file, and the stated licence must be the real one. A bundled asset outside the crate directory is absent from the published tarball |
| Public API of a published crate | `docs/hld/10-bindings-spec.md`, `CLAUDE.md` structural rules | Semver impact stated. `cargo publish --dry-run` and the `.crate` size assertion. No surface no story asked for |
| WASM or PyO3 bindings | `docs/hld/10-bindings-spec.md` | `cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Workspace test runs need `--exclude rdocx-py --exclude rpptx-py`, because `pyo3/extension-module` makes a test binary fail to link |
| A new feature flag or a change to `default` | `CLAUDE.md` structural rules | A named consumer that exists today. `cargo test -p oxml-layout --no-default-features` is the only thing exercising bundled fonts being off |
| A new trait, generic parameter, crate, module or file | `CLAUDE.md` structural rules | Name the second implementer or the second instantiation that exists **today**. A new crate, module or file needs an explicit ask first |
| An external oracle comparison | `.claude/skills/differential-testing.md` | Pin the oracle version and record it. An unpinned oracle turns its upgrade into your regression |
| Compatibility, numeric conversion or collection ordering | `.claude/commands/design.md`, Design validation before approval, and `.claude/skills/differential-testing.md`, Compatibility facts and oracle provenance | Pin the exact primary implementation, distinguish facts from choices, and specify field-specific ties, bounds and per-class ordering |
| XML creation in multiple parent contexts | `.claude/commands/design.md`, Design validation before approval, and the applicable schema | Record each qualified parent/content model, payload, order and cardinality. A valid block payload may be invalid inline |
| Release scripting, version strings | `.claude/commands/release.md`, `docs/hld/15-build-and-toolchain.md` | Inspect every manifest, lockfile and README version diff. Require a clean full gate and a separate final approval before tagging |
| Shared semantic behavior with multiple consumers | `.claude/skills/differential-testing.md`, Composition and discriminating fixtures | Consumer map and same-input comparison across relevant evaluation/update/serialize/render/reopen paths, including actual caller context |
| Grammar, scope, compatibility mode or empty collection | `.claude/skills/differential-testing.md`, Composition and discriminating fixtures | Risk-based zero/one/many and implicit/explicit/legacy/versioned cases, with known invalid input and atomicity controls |
| Completion status, capability ownership or evidence adoption | `.claude/WORKFLOW.md`, Acceptance contracts and composition checks | Rerun the policy checks whose metadata inputs changed after completion. Keep unaffected product evidence separate |
| Contributed PR or new issue acceptance | `.claude/commands/design.md`, Acceptance criteria | Pin issue body and PR head, map every acceptance row, preserve omitted/unreduced criteria, choose public API compatibility before adoption |
| A file move or rename with no behaviour change | `.claude/WORKFLOW.md`, the hash harness section | The harness must be byte-identical across the move. Never fold a behaviour change into a file move |

## Recording the result

Every design plan carries a `## Risk routing` section. Write the matched
triggers and the exact extra checks each one adds. If nothing matches, write
`none`. That is a common and valid answer for a story that only adds tests.

Cite the linked reference, do not copy it into the plan. The plan stays about
the decision and the acceptance evidence.

`/run-sprint` takes the union of every matched row across the sprint when it
builds the consolidated gate, so a rider one story earned runs once for the
whole sprint rather than once per worker.

## Why a router instead of running everything

`/verify --scoped F-XXX` is the feature-completion floor, and `/verify --full`
is the integrated sprint floor. The rows above add checks to the final integrated gate
when the feature earns them. Scoped completion uses unique local regressions. The
router exists so slow, manual, or environment-specific checks are chosen at
design time rather than remembered at review time.
