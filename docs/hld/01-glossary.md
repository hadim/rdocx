# 01, Glossary

Terms used precisely throughout this spec set. Where a word has a loose everyday
meaning and a strict OOXML meaning, the strict one is intended.

## The formats

**OOXML**, Office Open XML. The ECMA-376 family. A `.docx`, `.pptx` or `.xlsx`
is a ZIP archive of XML parts plus binary media.

**OPC**, Open Packaging Conventions. The container half of OOXML: the ZIP
layout, `[Content_Types].xml`, and the `_rels/` relationship files. Format
neutral. Everything in `oxml-opc` implements this and nothing above it.

**WordprocessingML**, the `w:` namespace. Word's document vocabulary. Lives in
`rdocx-oxml`.

**PresentationML**, the `p:` namespace. PowerPoint's vocabulary: presentations,
slides, layouts, masters, the shape tree. Lives in `rpptx-oxml`.

**SpreadsheetML**, the `x:` namespace. Excel's vocabulary. This repository
implements a deliberately minimal *writer* only, in `oxml-sml`, because every
chart embeds a workbook.

**DrawingML**, the `a:` namespace. The shared graphics vocabulary: transforms,
geometry, fills, lines, effects, colour schemes, and its own text model. Used by
all three formats. Lives in `oxml-drawing`. PowerPoint is roughly 90 percent
DrawingML, which is why that crate is the largest new body of work.

**ChartML**, the `c:` namespace. Charts. Lives in `oxml-chart`.

## The container

**Part**. One entry in the package, addressed by an absolute name such as
`/ppt/slides/slide1.xml`. In `OpcPackage` these are a `HashMap<String, Vec<u8>>`.

**Relationship**. A typed, directed edge from one part to another, or to an
external URI. Written in a sibling `_rels/<name>.rels` file and referenced from
the XML by an `r:id` such as `rId3`.

**Relationship scope**. The critical subtlety for PowerPoint. Each part has its
own relationship namespace, so `rId2` on a slide, `rId2` on its layout and
`rId2` on its master are three different targets. An `r:id` is therefore not a
valid global key for anything, which is why the renderer keys media by content
hash instead.

**Content type**. The MIME type of a part, declared either by a `Default` on the
file extension or by an `Override` on the exact part name. A missing override is
one of the most common causes of a file PowerPoint refuses to open.

## Units

OOXML uses a different unit almost everywhere. All of them live in `oxml-core`.

| Unit | Size | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| **EMU**, English Metric Unit | 1/914400 inch | DrawingML positions and sizes. The canonical internal unit of `Length` |
| **Twip** | 1/1440 inch | WordprocessingML measurements |
| **Half-point** | 1/2 point | `w:sz`, Word font size |
| **Centipoint** | 1/100 point | `a:rPr/@sz`, DrawingML font size. Not the same as a half-point |
| **60000ths of a degree** | | `a:xfrm/@rot`, `a:lin/@ang`. A right angle is 5400000 |
| **Thousandths of a percent** | | `a:lumMod val="75000"` means 75 percent |

EMU is chosen as the canonical unit because it divides evenly into both inches
and centimetres, and because it is what DrawingML already uses.

Word section geometry is stored in integer twips. Checked section-handle
setters accept `Length`, convert its complete EMU value by truncating toward
zero at 635 EMU per twip, and reject values outside the signed 32-bit twip
range before changing any property. Legacy final-section document convenience
setters retain their unchecked truncating behavior.

## The PowerPoint triangle

The single most important structural concept, and the one with no analogue in
Word.

**Slide master**. Defines the theme binding, the colour map, and the default
text styles for a family of layouts. A deck may have several.

**Slide layout**. Belongs to exactly one master. Defines the arrangement of
placeholders for one kind of slide, for example "Title and Content".

**Slide**. Belongs to exactly one layout.

**Placeholder**, `p:ph`. A shape carrying a `type` and an `idx`. A placeholder
on a slide inherits its position, size and text formatting from the matching
placeholder on its layout, which inherits from its master. **`idx` is the join
key.** Changing it severs inheritance silently, which is why `add_slide` never
renumbers it.

Placeholders on a layout or master are **templates and are never drawn**. A
renderer that draws them emits "Click to edit Master title style" into
production output.

**Shape tree**, `p:spTree`. The ordered list of shapes on a slide. Document
order is z-order. Its children are shapes, pictures, graphic frames, group
shapes and connectors.

## Colour

**Theme colour**. A named slot in `a:clrScheme`: `dk1`, `lt1`, `dk2`, `lt2`,
`accent1` through `accent6`, `hlink`, `folHlink`.

**Colour map**, `p:clrMap`. A per-master indirection from the semantic names
used in markup (`bg1`, `tx1`) to theme slots. `bg1` usually maps to `lt1`, but a
dark master inverts it. Resolution goes through the map *before* the theme.
Skipping this is the most common colour bug.

**Colour transform**. A modifier applied to a resolved colour, in document
order: `tint`, `shade`, `alpha`, `lumMod`, `lumOff`, `satMod`, `hueMod`, `gray`,
`comp`, `inv`. Office themes use `lumMod` and `lumOff` on nearly every
accent-derived colour, so omitting them makes an entire deck the wrong shade.

**Format scheme**, `a:fmtScheme`. Theme-level lists of fill, line and effect
styles that shapes reference by index through `p:style`. A `fillRef@idx` above
1000 means index `idx - 1000` into the background fill list.

## Geometry and text

**Preset geometry**, `a:prstGeom`. One of roughly 187 named shapes, each defined
in the spec as a parameterised path with adjustable values.

**Custom geometry**, `a:custGeom`. An explicit path using the same guide and
path machinery as the presets, which is why implementing presets properly costs
almost nothing extra once the evaluator exists.

**Guide**, `a:gd`. A named formula in a small stack language used to compute
path coordinates from the shape's width, height and adjust values.

**Text body**, `a:txBody`. DrawingML text: `a:bodyPr` for the frame,
`a:lstStyle` for nine levels of list formatting, then `a:p` paragraphs of `a:r`
runs of `a:t` text. Structurally parallel to `w:p`/`w:r`/`w:t` but a completely
different vocabulary.

**Autofit**. How text responds to a box that is too small. `a:noAutofit`
overflows, `a:spAutoFit` grows the shape, `a:normAutofit` shrinks the text and
**stores the scale it computed in the file**, which the renderer should trust
rather than recompute.

## Project vocabulary

**F-ID**. A story identifier, `F-001` onward. `F-X###` marks cross-cutting work
that belongs to no milestone.

**Test gate**. The smallest test that proves a story works. Every story has
exactly one. Nothing merges without it.

**Hash harness**. The output-stability check introduced in M1: a digest of each
sample document's XML parts and its rendered first page, compared before and
after every migration step. It exists because the extraction changes unit
conversion and text-shaping inputs, both of which alter output without failing
to compile.

**Deterministic font mode**. Rendering using only the bundled fonts, with system
font loading bypassed, so that a digest recorded on one machine matches one
recorded on another.

**Physical page number**. The one-based output-page identity stored in
`PageFrame::page_number`. Section restarts never change it.

**Displayed page number**. The value reset by `w:pgNumType/@w:start`, stored in
`PageFrame::displayed_page_number`, used for PAGE fields and header or footer
variant selection, and continued onto appended endnote pages.
